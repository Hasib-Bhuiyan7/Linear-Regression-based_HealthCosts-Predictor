# Linear-Regression-based_HealthCosts-Predictor
#This repository contains a regression-based Python tool for predicting healthcare costs. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a machine learning model that estimates medical expenses based on demographic and personal data.

#The model uses a sequential neural network architecture and is trained on a labeled dataset. It applies feature normalization to numerical inputs and encodes categorical features to ensure proper input representation. The target variable (expenses) is separated as training labels, and the dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

#To optimize performance, the model is tuned with a custom learning rate, and is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), aiming for an error under $3500. The project includes data preprocessing, model construction, training, evaluation, and prediction visualization on unseen data.
